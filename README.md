# Plane
A cross-platform C++ GUI framework.

It abstracts the entire graphics API and makes code built upon it fully compatible with every platform that implements the interface.

## Folder structure
* shared-cpp | contains the cross-platform C++ API of this library
* sdl-cpp | contains an implementation using SDL
* java-bridge | contains an implementation using JNI/Swing
* ios-bridge | contains an implementation using UIKit and CoreGraphics

## Setup using Eclipse
If you plan to develop using Eclipse open up this repository as a workspace.
